Photography Fun Day at the Pennypit

31 July 2015

![camera]


## Welcome

![karl]

I'm Karl, and I will be your tutor for today together with Ang.
I am a research student at The University of Edinburgh in computing, but I also have 
a personal interest in photography:

- I got my first digital camera more than 10 years ago.
- I've been teaching courses at Pennypit for three years now.
- This is the first time we're doing a photography fun day.
- I'm keen to build on ideas from you, and be flexible with topics and structure.

If you have any questions, just ask!


---

## What is photography?

Photography is about capturing light on a light sensitive medium (film).

It has a fascinating history. Development of film was very challenging due to
the chemical knowledge involved. The principles of seeing an image using a 
pinhole camera was described 4th and 5th BC in Greece and China. But the first
permanent photograph was only taken in 1826 (see picture below). 

![gras]

One of the earliest photographs. View from the Window at Le Gras, the first
successful permanent photograph created by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827, 
in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes. Captured on 20 × 25 cm oil-treated bitumen.
Due to the 8-hour exposure, the buildings are illuminated by the sun from 
both right and left.

Here are historical photographs of Edinburgh:

---

## Schedule

The aim of today is to explore your camera and experiment with taking pictures.

-Select photographs and describe the strengths and weaknesses of them using recognised terminology.
-Make suggestions for improvements to photographs.
-Present images to peer groups for critique.
-Participate in critiquing the work of others in their peer group.

    
The rough plan for today looks like this:

  - 9.15am – Welcome tea & coffee.
  - 9.30am – Morning session: outline of the day, discussion of ideas and the creative brief, photographic technique basics (composition).
  - 10.30am – Equipment checks over tea & coffee.
  - 11am – Travel to location.
  - 12.45pm – Return to Pennypit Centre for lunch.
  - 2pm – Afternoon session: presentations of images; peer critique;
  - 3pm – Advanced photographic techniques; exposure; aperture, shutter speed and ISO; Q&A; resources.
  - 4pm – Close

---

## Assignment

The purpose of the briefs is to give you a question, theme or goal to encourage you
to think about how you take pictures. There are three briefs, but you can also suggest
your own. You are encouraged to work with others!

Be prepared to present some of your pictures in class and discuss which 
ones you liked the most? Why? How did you create them? What did you learn by 
taking the pictures, and from the work of others in class? Remember, there often
isn't a right and wrong answer.

---

### Brief 1. Experimental portraiture - Can you take an unusual picture of someone?

People photography is popular, but very hard to do in an interesting way. Recruit a friend as model. Alternate between sitting model and taking pictures. Try out different ways of framing the shot, positioning the sitter, adjusting the way your model is lit and the range of emotions or gestures they can convey. Try both black and white, and colour. Instruct your model how to pose.

---

### Brief 2. Vertical landscapes - Most landscapes are shot horizontally, what happens when you shot vertically?

This is an example of constrait-based photography. This is where you change the way you normally shoot by imposing a rule on how you can take your picture. In this case, you have to work creatively with the new aspect ratio that vertical framing brings. By constraining some of your choices, you must think more critically about how you normally go about taking photos. If you want a additional challenge, you could try always shooting in backlit scenes (although this may not work summer at noon).

---

### Brief 3. Abstract art - Can you find and capture interesting patterns or fields of colour in your environment, perhaps from something that otherwise goes unnoticed?

Photographs can be visual art pieces that don't necessarily have to tell a story. This brief can give you a good opportunity to practice macro (close-up) photography, but you could also use non-macro techniques. Some suggestions include experimenting with the framing of the shot, arranging the subject matters and manual focusing (or use the pre-focus function of your camera by holding the shutter down half-way and then reframing before taking the picture). Scan your environment for textures (bark, dried ground, etc), fields of contrasting colour (sky/horizon; treelines; painted structures), interesting shapes, both organic and man-made. 

---


## Part1 - understanding your tools

During the morning session we will:

* Go over the main kinds of cameras, their parts and some terminology.
* Answer questions you may have about your own cameras and jargon.

---

### What is a camera?

Photography is often described as drawing with light, or light capturing. To
do this we need a camera. A camera consists of the following:

* A dark, light-tight chamber.
* A light sensitive film or CCD.
* An opening of a given size (called aperture) which lets in light.
  *  This could be a pinhole, or a lens.
* A shutter or curtain to open or close the opening.
  * Used to control how long the film is exposed to the light.

Did you recognise the camera obscura at the top?

---

### Types of digital cameras


It is useful to distinguish between different types of digital cameras:

* Camera phone (camera is an additional benefit; no zoom; few manual controls)
* Point and shoot (good first camera; often 3x zoom lens; compact; some manual control)
* Bridge camera (for more advanced users; often "superzoom" >10x zoom lens; larger; some more manual controls)
* DSLRs (usually bigger with larger sensor; interchangable lenses; manual control;)

DSLR stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex.

Generally going down the list, cameras become more expensive, yield better image quality,
and allows more creative control over photos.

---

### Components in a digital camera

Modern cameras are complex and contain many components, as you can see in this picture.

![cut]

---

#### CCD/CMOS Sensor (film)


* A light-sensitive silicon chip, developed in 1960 onwards.
* Has the same function as film in traditional cameras -- i.e. capture the image.
* CMOS is a competing and less common technology, which we won't discuss here.

![ccd]

---

#### CCD working principle

Here an attempt at a basic explanation:

* Instead of relying on chemical reaction (silver halide) like film, CCDs works through the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect photoelectric effect].
* In simple terms, electrons are freed when light strikes a surface (same principles as in solar cells).
* The CCD captures the pattern of freed electrons to make an image.
* The data is stored on a solid state drive memory card.

CCDs are complex, so if you are interested in self-study here are some further reading/watching:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device CCD article on Wikipedia]
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Za3FY1axI CCD inventors explain working principle] (Youtube)
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqJksXwrx7U Video of the making of a CCD] (Youtube)


---

#### Pixels, megapixels and resolution

![pixel]

* A pixel is a dot of a given colour.
* Digital images are made up of millions of pixels.
* Megapixel is a common measurement of the resolution of a ditigal image.
* A 10 megapixel camera would generate images that contain 10 million pixels.
* That would give images with a resolution of about 3648 by 2736 pixels (assuming 4:3 aspect ratio).

---

#### Sensor size and image quality

Image resolution (e.g. number of megapixels) and quality are usually conflated or thought to be the same thing.

This is not always so. Let's consider the role of sensor size.

![size]

* Just like film, CCD sensors come in different sizes (see picture).
* Sensor size is not the same as megapixel (image resolution).
* It is the physical dimension of the actual sensor.
* Big sensors are expensive and yield higher quality images than small.
* This is because a large sensors will have more photosites than a small sensor, yielding higher definition.
* Large sensors have less noise and are more suitable in low light and action photography.
* Large sensors also have a shallower depth of field, making it easier isolate a subject from the background.
* A small sensor is cheaper to make, requiring a smaller lens, and vice versa.
* Generally point and shoot cameras use smaller sensors than DSLRs.

We rarely hear about sensor size in camera advertisement. This is why:

* Increasing the megapixel resolution of the images is cheap.
* The camera essentially scales the image using the information from the same small sensor.
* This means you get less defined/sharp images than if you used a larger sensor.
* However, enlarging the sensor is expensive and would make cameras less affordable.
* Generally when you buy a camera, sensor size is more important for image quality than megapixels.

---

### Camera lens/objective

Apart from the film or sensor, another key part is the lens or objective.

* Lenses focus the light on the sensor/film.
* Lenses are made up of several glass elements (can be as many as 20).
* Some lenses have focusing and image stabilisation mechanisms built into them.
  * Point and shoot cameras with very small lenses can be slow to focus, especially in low light.
  * Stabilisation helps to get clear images when long shutter speeds are required.
  * Image stabilisation can be built into the sensor rather than the lens (e.g. Olympus does this)

---

#### Lens aperture (e.g. f/2.8)

* The aperture refers to the size of the opening of the front element of the lens.
* Often the aperture (e.g. f/3.5-5.6) is printed in the lens.
* Aperture determines the light gathering ability of a lens.
:* Aperture corresponds to the width in the [http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-exposure.htm bucket metaphore] (Cambridge in Colour)

A "fast" lens is a lens which has a large aperture and can collect a lot of light.

![f]

Common aperture sizes - notice as the f-number increases, the aperture (opening) decreases.

![f2]

A large (f/2.8) and small (f/16) aperture, achieved by opening and closing the diagragm.

---

#### Focal length (the amount of "zoom")

* The focal length of a lens is the field of view, or angle of view it can capture.
* Focal length depends on the sensor size.
* Because sensors can be of many sizes and shapes, the focal length of lenses are often specified in 35mm equivalents.
* This is a standard comparison because of 35mm film being common.

These are the main categories for 35mm equivalent focal lengths:

* Wide angle (<28mm)
* Normal (50mm)
* Portrait (around 100mm)
* Tele (>200mm)

Let's have a look at some examples on Wikipedia:
: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view#Examples

---

#### Zoom vs primes (fixed focal length lenses)

* A zoom lens is one which allows you to change the field of view (you may think of this as magnification)
* Zoom lenses are practical because you can change the composition easily.
:* For example to get more of the surrounding in the image by zooming out, or vice versa.
* The downside is that zooms may be less sharp and have a slower aperture than prime lenses.

* A prime lens is a lens with a single focal length.
* Because it has a single focal length it can be smaller, sharper and have a larger aperture than a zoom lens.
* But it takes more work to compose your images (you zoom with your feet).

---

#### Image engine

Once the CCD has captured the image data, the camera has onboard computer that saves the data into an image file.

The image engine is responsible for converting this data into a JPEG file.

Some cameras also have advanced features, including:

* Filters (black and white, colour tints, effects)
* Stitching several images together to form a panorama

---

#### Storage system

All digital cameras needs somewhere to store the images.

This is often on a solid state drive, or just a flash drive.

Different cameras use different memory cards, including:
* SDHC/SDXC (most common)
* Compact Flash (used on DSLRs)
* Various other sticks (less common)

---

#### Display and viewfinder

* All digital cameras nowadays have a display to allow you to view your pictures.

The display also contains useful information such as:
* Important settings, such as aperture and shutter speed.
* Battery and memory status (remaining pictures).
* Framing aids (e.g. grid).

Some cameras also have a viewfinder.

* A little window you can put your eye against and look through when composing the image.
* Can be optical or electronic (same view as on display)
* Viewfinders are less common on point and shoots, compared to DSLRs.
* But they really help to get less shaky pictures and see what you are doing.

---

#### Pop-up flash and hotshoe socket

* The flash adds light to a scene.
* Don't over use it - it causes unwanted and harsh highlights.
* Built-in camera flash doesn't have very long effective reach (a few meters only)

Some cameras have a hotshoe socket. This allows you to attach a more powerful flash to the camera.

---

#### Body and buttons


A camera is essentially a light tight box. We call this the body.

The design can vary a lot between manufacturers, but will typically have:

* Shutter button
* On/off switch
* Menu button and arrow keys
* Mode dials (e.g. Auto, P, A, S, M, Video)

---

#### Battery and connectivity

Cameras need power.

* NiMH rechargeable batteries are recommended for point and shoots.
* Rechargeable lithium batteries usually for DSLRs.

Cameras interface with your computer/TV via

* USB
* Memory card reader
* HDMI/VGA/Video-out
* Bluetooth, Wifi

It can also have:

* GPS, for recording position of where image was taken
* Shutter release control
* Microphone in (for video)

---

#### Other photographic equipment

* Filters
  * UV, neutral density (ND), Polarizing filter, star effect, etc.
* Tripod or monopod
* Light meters
* External flash (hotshoe, ring flash)
* Bounce cards/reflectors
* Grey cards
* Soft boxes

### Understanding exposure

Exposure is about getting the right amount of light on the film to get a good picture.

Exposure depends on four factors:

1. Available light in the scene.
  * Ambient or 'natural' light (e.g. the sun)
  * Controlled or 'artificial' light (e.g flash, lamps, reflectors)

2. Exposure time (aka. shutter speed).
  * A long shutter speed will expose the film to more light, giving a brighter picture
  * Examples of shutter speeds are 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000, 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/100, 1/50, 1/30, 1/15, 1/2, 1s, 2s, etc

3. Aperture size (size of lens opening).
  * A high aperture lets more light through, giving a brighter picture
  * Common aperture values are f/1.2, f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2, f/2.8, f/3.5, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, etc

4. Film sensitivity (ISO).'''
  * On digital, this is electronic amplification of the signal (as well as noise)
  * Higher ISO gives a brighter picture, but also more noise/grain.
  * Common ISO values are 100,200,400,800,1600,3200,6400, etc


A correctly exposed photo can be taken using different combinations of the four factors.

Once you understand the four factors you can use them to your advantage to take better photos.

* To learn more, see the [http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-exposure.htm exposure tutorial].

---

### The histogram

A histogram is a graph of the distribution of light in an image.

Many cameras have built in histogram previews.

Learning to interpret them can help you take better images.

* Left side of graph is black
* Middle is grey
* Right side is white

If the graph leans to the left, then the image is underexposed

If the graph tends towards the right, then the image is overexposed.

Here are some examples.

---

### Underexposure (too little light)

![u2]

---

### Overexposure (too much light)
![o]

### Correct exposure

### Metering and exposure compensation


When you press the shutter the camera will measure the light in the scene and attempt to set good values for shutter and aperture to get a correct exposure. This is called light metering.

Many cameras let you set light metering technique.
  Spot metering will measure the middle of the image only (overcomes the backlit situations)
  Average metering will look at light in the whole scene (works well usually)

Occasionally the camera's automatic light calculations may be off and you want to intervene manually.

Even if your camera doesn't give you control over shutter or aperture, you should still be able to compensate exposure.

The icon looks like a plus and minus [+/-].

For example if you are shooting a backlit scene, e.g someone standing indoors in front of a window.

In this case, you may want to:

* increase exposure to capture the person (and/or use flash) and blow out the window (becomes white).
* decrease exposure to only get the black outline of the person, but get the outside scene properly exposed.
* alternatively you may want to change to spot metering.

* To learn more, see the [http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-metering.htm metering tutorial].

---

### Dynamic range

A scene with very bright and very dark areas has what is called a "high dynamic range".

Dynamic range is a measure of the difference between the brightest and darkest area of a photograph.

Many cameras have problems capturing high dynamic range and will blow out highlights (becomes white) or loose details in shadows (becomes black).

---


### Exposure bracketing and HDR images

Some cameras will take multiple exposures of the same scene using different exposures.

This is called exposure bracketing.

* Bracketing is great if you are unsure what exposure is best.

* It is also possible to combine several exposures into a single image.

* This becomes what is called HDR (High Dynamic Range) photo.

![hdr]

# What makes a good photograph?

* Have a look at the criteria that Wikipedia uses to nominate Featured pictures.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_picture_criteria 

* Also, see this discussion of features pictures candidates

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_picture_candidates


Take 15 minutes looking at the criteria and discussion around some of the nominated images, noting down the following:

* What kind of aspects are important in supporting the nomination of an image to become featured?
* How have the images been manipulated? Compare the before and after versions.
* When can image manipulation make an image worse? 
* 
 
See this page for examples:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WIAFP/Examples_of_technical_problems

---

### Composition

Refers to how you frame the subject in the photography.

* How to position the camera?
  * Looking up, down, diagonally or straight on the subject?
* How to position the subject relative to the surrounding.
  * Center the picture on the the subject or use rule of thirds?
* What focal length, aperture and depth of field to use?
  * Getting close and personal, or use a wide angle to show surrounding?
* The perfect moment when to take the picture? (examples by Gregory Crewdson)
  * http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sEWmp48ncj8/TLciQ5tZ7jI/AAAAAAAACWo/9IkqEsg_Ndg/s1600/gregory_crewdson2_small.jpg

  * http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZUj0CDz9viM/TScgO-myKjI/AAAAAAAAIm4/TF0-klxMVws/s1600/04.BeneathTheRoses300dpi.jpg

---

### Rule of thirds

* Simply placing the main subject in the center is predictable and uninteresting.
* Instead the rule of thirds suggests that the subject should off center.
* Many cameras has a grid overlay with nine rectangles.
* The idea is that you can use this to compose your images.
* Position the subject on one of the intersections of the lines.
* Remember the rule of thirds is only a guideline.

---

### Depth of field

* Depth of field is the amount of an image that is in focus (see image example).
* Use depth of field to isolate the subject from the (often distracting) background.
* It depends on sensor size, aperture, focal length and distance to the subject:
: A larger sensor gives narrow depth of field (this is why many photographers like full frame DSLRs)
: A wide aperture gives a narrow depth of field (one reason for why large aperture lenses are desirable).
: A long focal length will narrow the depth of field (e.g. bird photography usually have only the bird in focus)
: A short distance to the subject will narrow the depth of field (e.g. macro photography).
* Lets use the [http://camerasim.com/camera-simulator/ camera simulator] to experiment with these settings.
* If you have access to a real camera, try isolating an object from the background.

---

### Other compositional techniques

There is an infinite number of ways in which to shoot interesting images, some possible ways include:

:* Colour/light contrast.
:* Perspective and lines.
:* Juxaposition (capturing objects that don't fit together).
:* Repetition (creating patterns).
:* Size (e.g. objects of various sizes).
:* Symmetry/asymmetry (e.g. reflections or mirror images).

---

### Some other things to bear in mind

* Composition is an active choice, and as important as getting the exposure right.

* Composition is as much about what we leave in the picture, as what we leave outside.

* Of course the photograph will be judge by others only based on what is in the picture.

* Think about what you want the photograph to say, and how to achieve this using composition.
: Going back to Gregory Crewdson, what does he want to say and how does he achieve it?

* There is no right and wrong, sometimes it can be hard to decide between different compositions.

* The answer is that you have to experiment, and critically analyse images you like.

* These are not absolute rules, just suggestions.

---

### Digital light room - image manipulation


How might computer graphics packages improve images?

* Allows you to work with images in non-destructive way.

* Revert back if you change your mind after comparing versions before and after.

* But there are cases where no amount of digital editing will improve a bad image.

---

### Potential areas for improvement

* Image dynamics (contrast, brightness, curves, equalisation).
* Colours (saturation, hues, white balance correction, gray-scale).
* Eliminate disturbing elements (clone tool, smoothing, blur).
* Cropping (free select, shapes, magic wand).
* Levelling/rotating skewed images.
* Adding visual effects and frames.
* Compositing multiple images together using overlays/layers.
* Advanced images processing (sharpening, de-noising, correcting for lens distortion and chromatic aberration, image focus stacking, high dynamic range, stitching panoramas, etc).
