# Welcome

![karl]

I'm Karl, and I will be your tutor for today together with Ang.
I am a research student at The University of Edinburgh in computing, but I also have 
a personal interest in photography:

- I got my first digital camera about 10 years ago.
- I've been teaching courses at Pennypit for three years now.
- This is the first time we're doing a photography fun day.
- I'm keen to build on ideas from you, and be flexible with topics and structure.

If you have any questions, just ask!

## Photography

Photography is about capturing light on a light sensitive medium (film).

It has a fascinating history. Development of film was very challenging due to
the chemical knowledge involved. The principles of seeing an image using a 
pinhole camera was described 4th and 5th BC in Greece and China. But the first
permanent photograph was only taken in 1826 (see picture below).

One of the earliest photographs. View from the Window at Le Gras, the first
successful permanent photograph created by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827, 
in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes. Captured on 20 × 25 cm oil-treated bitumen.
Due to the 8-hour exposure, the buildings are illuminated by the sun from 
both right and left.

## Purpose

The aim of today is to explore your camera and experiment with taking pictures.
I would like to encourage you to think about how you take pictures.

## Assignment

The purpose of the briefs is to give you a question, theme or goal to encourage you
to think about how you take pictures. There are three briefs, but you can also suggest
your own. You are highly encouraged to work with others! 
Be prepared to present some of your pictures in class and discuss which 
ones you liked the most? Why? How did you create them? What did you learn by 
taking the pictures, and from the work of others in class? Remember, there often
isn't a right and wrong answer.


### Brief 1. Experimental portraiture - Can you take an unusual picture of someone?

People photography is popular, but very hard to do in an interesting way. Recruit a friend as model. Alternate between sitting model and taking pictures. Try out different ways of framing the shot, positioning the sitter, adjusting the way your model is lit and the range of emotions or gestures they can convey. Try both black and white, and colour. Instruct your model how to pose.

### Brief 2. Vertical landscapes - Most landscapes are shot horizontally, what happens when you shot vertically?

This is an example of constrait-based photography. This is where you change the way you normally shoot by imposing a rule on how you can take your picture. In this case, you have to work creatively with the new aspect ratio that vertical framing brings. By constraining some of your choices, you must think more critically about how you normally go about taking photos. If you want a additional challenge, you could try always shooting in backlit scenes (although this may not work summer at noon).

### Brief 3. Abstract art - Can you find and capture interesting patterns or fields of colour in your environment, perhaps from something that otherwise goes unnoticed?

Photographs can be visual art pieces that don't necessarily have to tell a story. This brief can give you a good opportunity to practice macro (close-up) photography, but you could also use non-macro techniques. Some suggestions include experimenting with the framing of the shot, arranging the subject matters and manual focusing (or use the pre-focus function of your camera by holding the shutter down half-way and then reframing before taking the picture). Scan your environment for textures (bark, dried ground, etc), fields of contrasting colour (sky/horizon; treelines; painted structures), interesting shapes, both organic and man-made.
