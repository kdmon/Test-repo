<h1>1. Welcome to EPIC-BT UK</h1>

<p>This is the webpage for the ongoing UK online clinical trial entitled: <strong>Enhancing Prescription of Irradiated and CMV-negative Blood Transfusions (EPIC-BT)</strong>.</p>

<h2>1.1 Trial objectives </h2>

<p>The aim of the trial is to provide answers to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the current state of knowledge of irradiated and CMV-negative blood among prescribers of blood transfusion?<br/><br/></li>

<li>How does the use of a local guideline or similar interventions affect the prescription of irradiated and CMV-negative blood transfusions?<br/><br/></li>

<li>How do prescribers rate existing guidelines and interventions, and what form of training would they like to have access to in the future, if any?</li>

</ol>

<h2>1.2 Background and rationale</h2>

<p>Although blood transfusion in the UK is considered safe, mistakes occur in the prescription and administration of blood components. 
The prescription and administration of irradiated and cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative blood components, which fall under the umbrella turn "special requirements", continues to be an error-prone area of transfusion medicine.</p>

<p>Certain vulnerable transfusion patients have an elevated risk of developing transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease (TA-GvHD), a rare but usually lethal condition, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. These patients must be provided with irradiated and/or CMV negative blood components.</p>

<p>Every year close to one hundred mistakes related to special requirements are reported to SHOT, putting patients at unnecessary risk of GvHD and CMV infection.
Fortunately morbidities as a consequence of failure to provide irradiated or CMV negative blood components are rare, and preventative measures, such as universal leucodepletion is believed to have contributed in reducing the risk of adverse outcome further (SHOT).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the appropriate use of special blood components remain important in preventing Graft versus Host disease (TA-GvHD) (SHOT 2012). Similarly, the provision of CMV negative blood components prevent serious infection complications in high risk patient groups, such as neonates and fetuses, remain recommended clinical practice in the UK (SaBTO 2012).</p>
