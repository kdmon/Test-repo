            <h2>Background</h2>
            
            <p>Although blood transfusion in the UK is very safe, it is a complex process and mistakes can occur at various stages.</p>
            
            <p>Some patients have an elevated risk of developing transfusion-associated Graft versus Host Disease (TA-GvHD). This is a very rare but usually lethal condition that can be avoided by irradiating cellular blood components.</>
            
            <p>Transfusion can also transmit cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which can lead to serious conditions in vulnerable patients. CMV-negative blood components should therefore be provided to these patients.</p>
            
            <p>Every year approximately one hundred mistakes related to failures to provide irradiated and/or CMV negative blood components according to clinical guidelines are reported to the UK haemovigilance scheme SHOT.</p>
            
            <p>This trial will investigate the effectiveness of an app-based learning intervention in reducing mistakes and raising awareness of the underlying causes.</p>
