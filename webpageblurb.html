            <h2>Background</h2>
            
            <p>Although blood transfusion in the UK is very safe, it is a complex process and mistakes can occur at various stages.</p>
            
            <p>Some patients have an elevated risk of developing transfusion-associated Graft versus Host Disease (TA-GvHD). This is a very rare but usually lethal condition that can be avoided by irradiating cellular blood components.</>
            
            <p>Transfusion can also transmit cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which can lead to serious conditions in vulnerable patients. CMV-negative blood components should therefore be provided to these patients.</p>
            
            <p>Every year approximately one hundred mistakes related to failures to provide irradiated and CMV-negative blood components to patients according to guidelines are reported to the UK haemovigilance scheme SHOT.</p>
            
            <p>This trial will investigate the effectiveness of an app-based learning intervention in enhancing prescribers' knowledge and raising awareness of the underlying causes.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
        
            <ol>
              <li>What is the current state of knowledge of the indications for irradiated and CMV-negative blood components among doctors and nurses who prescribe blood?<br/><br/></li>

              <li>How do access to a mobile app influence prescription of irradiated and CMV-negative blood in simulated patient scenarios?<br/><br/></li>

              <li>How do prescribers rate the mobile app and existing interventions, such as local and UK guidelines?</li>
            
            </ol>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Randomised controlled trial comparing participants' prescribing behaviour under two conditions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Current practice based on access to local and national guidelines (control group).<br/><br/></li>
              <li>Novel intervention based on access to an app with learning material (treatment group)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Participants are randomly allocated one of the trial arms. To provide a baseline and capture group variance, participants are asked to answer a pre- and post-test with ten questions based on simulated patient scenarios.</p>
            <p>Please see protocol for a schematic.</p>
