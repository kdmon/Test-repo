        <h2>1.1 Trial objectives </h2>
        
            <p>The aim of the trial is to provide answers to the following questions:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>What is the current state of knowledge of irradiated and CMV-negative blood among prescribers of blood transfusion?<br/><br/></li>
            
            <li>How does the use of a local guideline or an app affect the prescription of irradiated and CMV-negative blood transfusions?<br/><br/></li>
            
            <li>How do prescribers rate existing guidelines and interventions?</li>
            
            </ol>
            
        
        <h2>1.2 Background and rationale</h2>
        
        <p>Although blood transfusion in the UK is considered safe, it is a complex process and serious mistakes can occur at various stages in the process.</p>
        
        <p>The prescription and administration of irradiated and cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative blood components continues to be an error-prone area of transfusion medicine.</p>
        
        <p>Certain patients have an elevated risk of developing transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease (TA-GvHD), a rare but usually lethal condition. Others are at risk of transfusion transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.</p>
        
        <p>These patients have "special requirements" and must be provided with irradiated and/or CMV negative blood components according to clinical guidelines.</p>
        
        <p>Every year close to one hundred mistakes related to failures to meet special requirements are reported to the UK haemovigilance scheme SHOT.</p>
        
        <p>This put patients at unnecessary risk of TA-GvHD and CMV infection. The appropriate use of irradiated blood components is important in preventing TA-GvHD (BCSH 2010). CMV negative blood components can prevent serious infection complications in high risk patients (SaBTO 2012).</p>
        
        <p>This trial aims to increase knowledge and awareness of this issue, and investigate interventions that could reduce mistakes and risks to patients.</p>
