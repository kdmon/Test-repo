            <h2>Objectives</h2>
        
            <p>The aim of the trial is to provide answers to the following questions:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>What is the current state of knowledge of irradiated and CMV-negative blood component use among prescribers of transfusion?<br/><br/></li>
              
              <li>How does the use of a local guideline or an app affect the prescription of irradiated and CMV-negative blood transfusions?<br/><br/></li>
              
              <li>How do prescribers rate existing guidelines and interventions?</li>
            
            </ol>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            
            <p>Although blood transfusion in the UK is considered safe, it is a complex process and mistakes can occur at various stages in the process.</p>
            
            <p>In some scenarios transfusions carry an elevated risk of causing transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease (TA-GvHD). This is a rare but usually lethal condition.  At other times there may be a high risk of transfusion transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.</p>
            
            <p>To avoid these risks, patients with special requirements must be provided with irradiated and/or CMV negative blood components according to clinical guidelines.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the prescription and administration of irradiated and cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative blood components continues to be an error-prone area of transfusion medicine.</p>
            
            <p>Every year close to one hundred mistakes related to failures to meet these special requirements are reported to the UK haemovigilance scheme SHOT. Fortunately the likelyhood of developing TA-GvHD or CMV infection is small, but these mistakes continue to put patients at unnecessary risk.</p>
            
            <p>This trial will increase knowledge and awareness of the problem, and attempt to gauge the effectiveness of  interventions in reducing certain kinds of mistakes.</p>
